					<h3 class="projectTitle">Multiplayer Space Shooter</h3>
					<p>Developed in Unity, for COSC 729 (Virtual Reality and its Applications) at Bowie State University, my partner and I built a small multiplayer space shooter using <a href="https://github.com/BeardedManStudios/ForgeNetworkingRemastered">Forge Networking Remastered</a>. The space backdrop was drawn using Affinity Photo Editor. All 3D models can be found at <a href="https://kenney.nl/">Kenney</a> or in Unity's Asset Store. Link to github below.</p>

					<h3 class="projectTitle">FPS Bots trained with Unity's Reinforcement Learning Libraries</h3>
					<p>Developed in Unity, for COSC 698 (Applied Research in Computer Science) at Bowie State University, our team modified existing <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents">Unity ML-Agents</a> assets to create a couple of deathmatch scenarios. This video shows one of a hundred matches on the training map to evaluate performance between varous Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic Agents. All 3D models can be found at <a href="https://kenney.nl/">Kenney</a>. Paper to be submitted for publishing soon. Link to github below.</p>

					<h3 class="projectTitle">Maze of the Minotaur</h3>
					<p>This was my Udacity Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project. In it, you are a treasure hunter seeking to find 8 gems in a maze full of malicious baddies. Armed with your trusty raygun, you must find a way to exit safely with as many gems as possible. Developed for Google Cardboard on Unity, and tested on a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.</p>

					<h3 class="projectTitle">A Night at the Museum</h3>
					<p>This project was also a part of the Udacity Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree. This project is a showcase of various Virtual (and Augmented) reality capabilities. It features several videos showing VR (and AR) applicaitons such as Serious Sam VR, Google Earth VR, and Microsoft Hololens. </p>

					<h3 class="projectTitle">The Maze</h3>
					<p>The Maze was one of my favorite Udacity Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree projects, and provided inspiration for my capstone project, the Maze of the Minotaur. The focus of this project was to demonstrate locomotion, and the basics of animation in Unity.</p>
