					<h3 class="projectTitle">Maze of the Minotaur</h3>
					<p>This was my Udacity Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project. In it, you are a treasure hunter seeking to find 8 gems in a maze full of malicious baddies. Armed with your trusty raygun, you must find a way to exit safely with as many gems as possible. Developed for Google Cardboard on Unity, and tested on a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.</p>

					<h3 class="projectTitle">The Maze</h3>
					<p>The Maze was one of my favorite Udacity Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree projects, and provided inspiration for my capstone project, the Maze of the Minotaur. The focus of this project was to demonstrate locomotion, and the basics of animation in Unity.</p>

					<h3 class="projectTitle">Neural Style Transfer</h3>
					<p>This was one of the final projects in Coursera's DeepLearning Specialization. Here, I  trained a neural network to imitate the brush strokes from one image, and apply it to a photo I took at Alki Beach, in West Seattle, see above!</p>
